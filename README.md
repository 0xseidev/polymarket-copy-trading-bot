## 🛡️ Safety First

### ⚠️ Important Warnings

- **Real Money, Real Risk** - This bot executes actual trades with your funds
- **Start Small** - Test with minimal amounts first
- **Diversify** - Don't put all your eggs in one trader's basket
- **Monitor Daily** - Check logs regularly to ensure proper operation

### Best Practices

1. **Use a separate wallet** - Don't use your main wallet

4. **Set up monitoring** - Know what's happening with your trades
5. **Learn the stop command** - Ctrl+C stops the bot immediately
